Welcome to my website! I’m Arnav, a passionate computer science student at the University of Mumbai, currently on an exciting journey in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Expected to graduate in 2027, I have been actively involved in impactful research, industry collaborations, and continuous learning to drive innovation in AI and technology.

## Academic Background

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Mumbai, where I have developed a strong foundation in core subjects, including:
- **Core CSE Topics**: Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, COA, Advanced Distributed Systems, Computer Graphics, DBMS, OS, Deep Learning, DSA, etc.  
- **Core Math Topics**: Differential Equations, Discrete Calculus, Matrix Computation, Regression, Probability, Linear and Abstract Algebra, etc.

These subjects serve as the backbone of my technical pursuits.

## Research & Internships

My academic journey has been enriched with research internships at prestigious institutions:

- **Harvard University**  
  - LLM inference optimization for VIDUR under Professor Devashree Tripathy, quantifying speedups achieved.  
  - Successfully tested “control knobs” for LLM inference.  
  - Contributed to features like Chrome Tracing integration, synthetic data generation, and distributed computing aspects.  
  - Integrated specific LLMs (such as Meta-Llama and CodeLlama) into the framework.  
  - Key contributions: Performance Optimization, Specific Feature Development, Profiling, Tooling & Infrastructure.

- **JuliaHealth**  
  - Developed GPU-accelerated containers for medical imaging.  
  - Created a new simulation method, BlochKernel, with multi-vendor GPU support.  
  - Documented the new simulation method.  
  - Implemented automatic pipelines on Buildkite for testing simulations across multiple GPU architectures.  
  - Reported performance improvements between BlochKernel and Bloch.

- **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**  
  - Worked under Dr. Chris Grunseich in identifying potential biomarkers for lung cancer.  
  - Analyzed serum and plasma datasets using tests like Bartlett's and Levene's to uncover biomarkers.  
  - Achieved 90% accuracy on serum samples and 99% accuracy on plasma samples by correlating RNA sequencing and proteomics data.

- **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**  
  - Worked on two datasets (each with 3-4 million rows and 65 columns) for a Click-Through Rate Model in marketing.  
  - Achieved over 70% accuracy in a short timeframe and created synthetic datasets using the CTGAN model.  
  - Performed Remote Attestation, Dockerized files, and used Intel TDX and SGX SDK kits for file encryption and privacy.

## Projects

### Computational Identification and Validation of Novel Biomarkers for Lung Cancer
- Analyzed potential biomarkers for lung cancer in plasma and serum samples.
- Employed Bartlett's and Levene's tests to reveal biomarkers.
- Achieved prediction accuracy of ~99% for plasma samples and 90% for serum samples.  
- [Check out my GitHub repository](https://github.com/w2sg-arnav/stanford_hacks).

### Synthia: Synthetic Data Generation with AI Workbench
- Fine-tuned Phi-3 mini-4k-instruct to tokenize queries for the CTGAN model.  
- Used Nvidia AI Workbench to create custom containers from Nvidia NGC.  
- Developed a model for generating custom synthetic data based on user needs.  
- [GitHub Link](https://github.com/W2SG-smokiee/nvidia_ai) (private repo).
