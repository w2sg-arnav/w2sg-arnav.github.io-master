# About Arnav Sonavane

Welcome to my website! I’m Arnav Sonavane, a passionate computer science student at the University of Mumbai, currently on an exciting journey in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and medical imaging. Expected to graduate in 2027, I have been actively involved in impactful research, industry collaborations, and continuous learning to drive innovation in AI and technology.

## Academic Background

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Mumbai, where I have developed a strong foundation in core subjects including Computer Architecture, Networks, Advanced Distributed Systems, Deep Learning, Data Structures, and Algorithms. Alongside, I have honed my mathematical expertise in areas like Differential Equations, Probability, and Matrix Computation, all of which serve as the backbone for my technical pursuits.

## Research & Internships

My academic journey has been enriched with research internships at prestigious institutions:

- **Harvard University**: I am working on LLM inference optimization under Professor Devashree Tripathy, contributing to VIDUR’s latency prediction and feature integration, including Chrome Tracing and synthetic data generation.
- **JuliaHealth**: I am developing GPU-accelerated containers for medical imaging simulations and introduced the BlochKernel simulation method for multi-GPU support.
- **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**: Focused on lung cancer biomarker identification, I achieved remarkable accuracy in identifying biomarkers, especially in plasma sample analysis.

These experiences have expanded my skill set in tools like Docker, GitHub, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more, which are critical to advancing AI-driven solutions in healthcare.

## Projects

### Computational Identification and Validation of Novel Biomarkers for Lung Cancer
I led a comprehensive study on potential biomarkers for lung cancer using plasma and serum samples, achieving prediction accuracies up to 99%. This project not only involved biomarker analysis but also applied data integration techniques that are essential for translating bioinformatics research into real-world applications.

### Synthia: Synthetic Data Generation with AI Workbench
Using Nvidia’s AI Workbench and Phi-3 mini-4k-instruct model, I developed a customizable synthetic data generator to create datasets for diverse analytical needs, allowing users to specify and tokenize queries for synthetic data creation.

## Awards & Honors

I have been recognized for my contributions and achievements at several prestigious competitions, including:

- **Winner** of the Live-AI Global Harvard-Duke Hackathon.
- **2nd Place** at GES x UCLA Hackathon.
- **Winner** of Stanford Biohacks Hackathon.
- Recipient of **SOF International Olympiads** in Maths, Physics, and Science.

These awards reflect my dedication to continuous learning and my competitive edge in the field of AI and machine learning.

## Technical Skills

### Programming Languages
I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Go, with extensive experience in both machine learning and web development environments.

### Machine Learning Libraries
My toolkit includes PyTorch, TensorFlow, SciPy, NumPy, Sk-Learn, and Pandas, allowing me to develop, test, and optimize ML models efficiently.

### Web & Database Development
Experienced in frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Flask/Django, I also work with databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, ensuring seamless data management for my projects.

### DevOps
With a strong grasp of Docker, Docker-Compose, and Kubernetes, I aim to optimize the deployment and scaling of machine learning applications. I am also familiar with Git, GitHub Actions, and Shell Scripting, adding flexibility to my development workflow.

## Publications

### Integration of IoT and Quantum Computing
Published a chapter titled *"Integration of IoT and Quantum Computing: Revolutionizing Manufacturing"* with IGI Global, delving into the intersections of emerging technologies and their potential impact on modern manufacturing.

### HepaScope: Liver and Tumor Segmentation
Accepted at the 13th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, my research on using UNet architectures for liver and tumor segmentation reflects my ongoing dedication to impactful AI in healthcare.

## Beyond Academics

In addition to my technical work, I am a sports enthusiast, having represented my college in university games for badminton and table tennis. I also enjoy contributing to academic communities as a class representative and have actively participated in international spelling bees and scholastic tournaments.
