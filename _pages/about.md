Welcome to my website! I’m Arnav, a passionate computer science student at the University of Mumbai, currently on an exciting journey in artificial intelligence, machine learning. Expected to graduate in 2027, I have been actively involved in impactful research, industry collaborations, and continuous learning to drive innovation in AI and technology.

## Academic Background

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Mumbai, where I have developed a strong foundation in core subjects including Core CSE topics like: Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, COA, Adv. Distributed Systems, Computer
Graphics, DBMS, OS, Deep Learning, DSA, etc. Alongside, I have honed my mathematical expertise in areas like Core Math topics: Differential Equations, Discrete Calculus, Matrix Computation, Regression, Probability, Linear and Abstract Algebra, etc., all of which serve as the backbone for my technical pursuits.

## Research & Internships

My academic journey has been enriched with research internships at prestigious institutions:

- **Harvard University**:  LLM inference optimization for VIDUR under Professor Devashree Tripathy, quantifying speedups achieved.
● Successfully testing “control knobs” for the LLM inference
● Contributed to particular features like the Chrome Tracing integration, synthetic data generation, & distributed
computing aspects.
● Worked on integrating specific LLMs (like Meta-Llama or CodeLlama) into the framework.
● Key contributions: Performance Optimization, Specific Feature Development, Profiling, Tooling &
Infrastructure.
- **JuliaHealth**: Developing GPU accelerated containers for medical imaging
● Improved GPU-accelerated simulations, having generated a new simulation method BlochKernel with
multi-vendor GPU support
● Developed documentation explaining the new simulation method
● Implemented automatic pipelines on Buildkite for testing the simulations across multiple GPU
architectures.
● Reported performance improvements between BlochKernel and Bloch.
- **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**: Worked under the domain of "Analyze gene expression data to identify potential biomarkers for a disease"
for Dr. Chris Grunseich
● Successfully reviewed and analyzed/identified potential biomarkers for Lung Cancer, I have taken datasets of
serum and plasma and analyzed using different tests like: Bartlett's test, Levene's test, etc to uncover
potential biomarkers.
● Working on Biomarkers, correlating RNA sequencing and proteomics and working on the datasets, achieved
90% accuracy on serum samples and around 99% accuracy on plasma samples

- **University of California (Los Angeles)**: Worked on 2 datasets of 3 to 4 million rows and 65 columns (apiece) for a Click Through Rate Model for the advertisements and feeds of the marketing industry, under the guidance of Prof. Chi Hua Wang.
● Achieved 70+% accuracy in a short span of time, and created Synthetic Datasets using CTGAN model.
● Did Remote Attestation, used Docker Images and Encrypted the files for privacy, using Intel TDX
and SGX ,SDK kits

## Projects

### Computational Identification and Validation of Novel Biomarkers for Lung Cancer
Successfully reviewed and analyzed/identified potential biomarkers for Lung Cancer
● Took datasets of serum and plasma and analyzed using different tests like: Bartlett's test, Levene's
test, etc to uncover potential biomarkers.
● Although I faced a reduced number of metabolites, the prediction accuracy was around 99-100 % for plasma
samples and 90 % for serum samples. [Check out my GitHub repository](https://github.com/w2sg-arnav/stanford_hacks)

### Synthia: Synthetic Data Generation with AI Workbench
Fine-Tuned Phi-3 mini-4k-instruct to tokenize query for CTGAN model to read the query .
● Used Nvidia AI Workbench for creating custom containers from Nvidia NGC.
● This model lets you create your own custom synthetic data according to your needs. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/W2SG-smokiee/nvidia_ai)
